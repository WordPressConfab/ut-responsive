ut-responsive
=============

UT Responsive - a UT branded responsive theme for WordPress.

This is a child theme of [ThemeID's Responsive](http://themeid.com/responsive), so you'll need to install that theme as well if you're using this on your own WordPress instance.

If you act now (and are currently an employee or student at [The University of Texas at Austin](http://utexas.edu)), you can get your own blog on the [University Blog Service](https://blogs.utexas.edu), which comes with the UT Responsive theme already installed!
