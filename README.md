ut-responsive
=============

UT Responsive - a UT branded responsive theme for WordPress.

This is a child theme of [ThemeID's Responsive](http://themeid.com/responsive), so you'll need to install that theme as well if you're using this on your own WordPress instance.

We started with [version 1.8.0 of Responsive](http://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/9709). Also, this version had [TinyNav](https://github.com/viljamis/TinyNav.js) version 0.3, but we dropped in a [slightly newer version](https://github.com/viljamis/TinyNav.js/commit/db939b2693c004d96245220338fae66e84c4ed1c) which includes the option to add a \<label\> tag to the nav dropdown.

If you act now (and are currently an employee or student at [The University of Texas at Austin](http://utexas.edu)), you can get your own blog on the [University Blog Service](https://blogs.utexas.edu), which comes with the UT Responsive theme already installed!
