ut-responsive
=============

UT Responsive - a UT branded responsive theme for WordPress, with a header image size of 960x320

This is a child theme of [CyberChimps' Responsive](http://cyberchimps.com/responsive-theme/), so you'll need to install that theme as well if you're using this on your own WordPress instance.

As of this build, we were using [version 1.9.4.6 of Responsive](https://wordpress.org/themes/responsive/developers/).

Shameless Plug

If you act now (and are currently an employee or student at [The University of Texas at Austin](http://utexas.edu)), you can get your own blog on the [University Blog Service](https://sites.utexas.edu), which comes with the UT Responsive theme already installed!
